# Deep learning for eastimating dissolved oxygen in global ocean

## Introduction
Dissolved oxygen (DO) has far-reaching impacts on ocean biodiversity, productivity, and biogeochemical cycles, showing a decline trend by in-situ measurements and model simulation during the past five decades. Comprehensive understanding of DO is hindered by limited measurement data and inadequate spatial resolution or skill of process-based models. We built a transformer-based (Oxyformer) deep learning method using hydrometeorological and biogeochemical driver data to estimate global ocean DO concentration. Oxyformer provides daily DO concentration estimation throughout whole water column at spatial resolution of 0.25° × 0.25°. Moreover, Oxyformer’s accuracy is higher than other methods in the areas with different driven factors (such as at open ocean and coastal water), especially overcoming weakness of overestimation for DO concentration in hypoxia regions. An interpretable analysis indicates Oxyformer employed plausible drivers to estimate DO concentration. The Oxyformer model is a powerful tool for both oceanic DO concentration estimation and for modeling its complex DO variations on marine-system.
